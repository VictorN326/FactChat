# Harmony

Harmony is a messaging chat application similar to discord. The chat has a signup and signin page for accounts and when logged in, you can add people into your direct messages or create a group chat channel. With the application, you are able to edit channels by editing the channel name or add new members if they have already signed up. With this feature, it only allows for the channel owners to edit the channels for security purposes. With this application, you cannot only send messages but also send emojis and gifs or giphys, reply to messages/threads, add photos and delete messages. It also integrates time stamps to see when the message was sent and also includes Twilio functionality that will send SMS notification to your phone if you signed up with your actual phone number. Although it's a cool functionality, I don't recommend it to everyone as you can get spammed with this if you are not online if someone decides to message you but you can always mute it or block it. 

1. When Creating an account, you fill out the form and for avatar image URL, I recommend using online images that have image formats such as .jpg .jpeg and etc but it doesn't always guarantee for other avatar images on google. 
    A) If you want to use a google image of anything as your avatar, you go to google images, right click on the image and click on copy image address or             open image in new tab and make sure that the image is a image file of similar to .jpg or .jpeg and such. 
    
2. After making an account, you can sign in with the account you made and start chatting away! If you don't want to make your own account, that is okay!  I've made some preset accounts that you can use and try it out. They are all accounts with dummy phone numbers so don't worry about SMS notification. You can sign in with one of these four accounts or signin/signout with each of them (one at a time) to see the chat application functionality if no one is online.

  Sign in with these 5 accounts (yes they all have same passwords for simplicity):
  
    1. username: BlackPinkLisa   pass: abc123
    
    2. username: BlackPinkJisoo  pass: abc123
    
    3. username: BlackPinkRose   pass: abc123
    
    4. username: BlackPinkJennie pass: abc123
    
    5. username: BaeSuzii        pass: abc123
    
    If you wantt to send giphys, the command is: /giphy [text]
      example can be:
      1. /giphy hi 
      2. /giphy cool
